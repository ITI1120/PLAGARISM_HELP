# PLAGARISM_HELP
Tools to help you cheat


When cheating, ensure that your code is different enough from the ones I show here. The following tool:

https://pypi.org/project/pycode-similar/

Will help with that. It checks the similarity of your code against the one you are using. I've found that code which is >30% similar does not get discovered as being copied. 


Methods that will not work:

Linting, will not alter the structure, just the variables and shape

Swapping function location, this will fail every time and will cause the TA to check closer for plagarism. It is a well known tactic to use.
